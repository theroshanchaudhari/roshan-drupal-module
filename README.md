# A Drupal via DDEV template on Gitpod

This is a [Drupal via DDEV](https://github.com/drud/ddev) template configured for ephemeral development environments on [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).
To now more about this: [How to install Drupal locally using DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/quickstart/#drupal).

## Next Steps

Click the button below to start a new development environment, though, if you wish to keep the changes you make in the new dev environment, it's recommended that you create your own repository based on this one, in order to do that, you should:

1. If you don't have one, create a [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) account using your GitHub account.
2. Check your permissions on [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io/workspaces):
    - Click on the user image, then "User Settings"
    - Click on "Git Providers" on the sidebar
    - Click on the three dots on the GitHub line, then on "Edit Permissions"
    - Select everything except "read:org"
4. Click on the button "Use this template" in the top right corner of this repository.
5. Add a name for your new project and save it as a public repository.
6. Once the repo is created, edit the README file to change the URL of the "Open in Gitpod" button. The current URL reflects the author of this repo, you should change the username and the repo name so the button targets your new repository (in line 21 of this file). Once the changes are done, save the file by clicking on the button "Commit changes".
7. Click on the button "Open in Gitpod":

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/green-onions/gitpod-starter)

Note: Once the environment has been created you'll find yourself inside of the project folder with DDEV already setup and the site installed.
